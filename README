This repo contains code needed to run the analysis to fit the probit unfolding model to Voteview data about the 100th to 117th House. It can also fit the dynamic probit unfolding model to Supreme Court data used to derive Martin-Quinn scores.

Note that this repo do not contain those data sets. They have to be downloaded and placed in the data_files directory. In addition, the result_files directory is empty, but added as a directory for the output.
